# DeadlineReminderApp
This is a deadline reminder app developed using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. This dynamic website allows you to store deadline reminders with respective dates.
The reminders are categorised into three categories namely; Today, Tomorrow and Upcoming. The reminder data are added to each category with respective to it's date condition.
On each day, the reminder data are updated so that the reminders move from one category to the other (for egs: a task assigned for Tomorrow will be updated to Today reminder list).
